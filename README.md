# Champion-Feats
Stack the deck in your favour, if you want

Adds a series of "Champion" feats that will stack the game in your favour, in exchange for paying a feat slot for them. Obviously not based in tabletop. Or any strong sense of game balance.

Specifically adds:

Champion Protection - adds a +1/+2/+3 AC bonus depending on whether you're wearing light, medium, or heavy armour. Scales as you increase in character level, up to +24 AC when wearing Heavy Armour with a level 40 character.

Champion Guard - adds a +5 DR/- bonus. Every 5th level increases it by another +5.

Champion Aim - adds a +1 attack bonus to any weapon. Increases by +2 for every two levels starting at level 3.

Champion Saves - adds +2 per level to all saving throws

Champion Skills - adds a +1 bonus to all skill checks. Increases by +1 for every two levels starting at level 3. This can be toggled to add directly to skill ranks if desired, avoiding issues with untrained skill checks and checks against skill ranks that ignore bonuses.

Champion Strikes - adds +1 damage to any weapon attacks. Increases by +1 for every three levels starting at level 4.

Champion Spell Blasts - adds +1 damage to spell attacks. Increases by +1 for every three levels starting at caster level 4.

Champion Spell Force - adds +1 to the DCs of your spells. Increases by +1 for every caster level.

Champion Spell Penetration - adds half your caster level to the spell penetration stat of your spells. If you also take the basic Spell Penetration feat, this increases to a full caster level bonus.

You can adjust whether these should be considered normal feats or Mythic feats if you want to make it a bit harder for you in a playthrough you're using this mod in.

All Champion feat bonuses can be modified, to not only change the bonus provided but also how many level steps are required per bonus increase i.e. +1 every two levels or +5 every level.

**How to install**

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manager and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the Champion Feats mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab

**How to build** (updated)
Now requires you first create an environment variable, called WrathInstallDir, containing the path to the base Wrath folder. All Wrath includes are now relative to that value.

**Thanks**

Vek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked.
